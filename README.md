# CORD-19 Metadata Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the `metadata.csv` file from the CORD-19 dataset.  
It explores COVID-19 research publications by year, journal, and title keywords.  
The project also includes a **Streamlit app** for interactive visualization.

## Reflection
Learned to handle missing values and datetime formats.
Gained practice in word frequency visualization.
Built an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

## Tools
- Python 3.7+
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- wordcloud
- streamlit
- jupyter
